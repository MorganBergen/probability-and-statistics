# Probability, Statistics, and Stochastic Processes
Intended for Electrical and Computer Engineers using Matlab

This is an introduction to probability and statistics with computer engineering applications.  These applications include the testing the reliability of systems, discrete and continuous random variables, expectations, functions of random variables, and linear regression.  There will additionally be an emphasis on sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.  Joint, marginal, and conditional distribution and densities.  

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate an introduction to the theory, tools, and techniques for working wth probabilistic events and statistical analysis from a computer engineering perspective.
