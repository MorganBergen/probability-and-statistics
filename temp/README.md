# Probability, Statistics, and Stochastic Processes
Intended for Electrical and Computer Engineers using Matlab

This is an introduction to probability and statistics with computer engineering applications.  These applications include the testing the reliability of systems, discrete and continuous random variables, expectations, functions of random variables, and linear regression.  There will additionally be an emphasis on sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.  Joint, marginal, and conditional distribution and densities.  

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate an introduction to the theory, tools, and techniques for working wth probabilistic events and statistical analysis from a computer engineering perspective.

### Topics
Probability Foundations

Sequential Experiments

Discrete Random Variables

Continuous Random Variables

Multiple Random Variables

Functions of Random Variables

Conditional Probability Models

Sums of Random Variables

The Sample Mean

Hypothesis Testing

eecs 461 students,

here is some information regarding the upcoming midterm exam.

- date, time, place
        - monday 7 november from 5-7 pm in learned 1131.
- material covered
        - lectures 1 through 4
        - chapters 1 through 4
        - assignments 1-8 (only problems 1 and 2 on hw 8) (*not* hw 9 or hw 10)
- types of problems to expect
        - problems similar to textbook examples, quizzes, and hw problems
        - we have not emphasized proofs a lot, but there may be a simple proof on the exam
- you are allowed to bring
        - notes on *one* side of *one* sheet of 8.5 by 11 inch paper
        - pencil, eraser, and non-communicating calculator (*not* a calculator on a smart phone)
- thursday's class
        - *no* quiz this week
        - class will be a info/review/help session for hw and exam (no new material introduced)
- exam prep strategy and practice problems:
        - if you have not been doing the reading from the textbook, do it!
        - if you have not been working through examples in the textbook, treat them as practice problems
                - work them without reading the solution given by the book, then check your work with the book solution
        - if you have not been doing the practice quizzes from the textbook, do them!
                - full solutions to these are available from the publisher on the web
        - review lecture notes
                - if i gave you an Exercise or told you to study something from the text, do it!
        - review ALL homework pr
        - work odd-numbered problems at the end of each chapter
                - full solutions to these are available from the publisher on the web
- hw 11
        - it is short, but it *is* due tue 8 november (the day after the exam)
        - my recommendation: do this first, then focus attention on preparing for exam
